# Regression

Regression is **a technique for investigating the relationship between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome**. It's used as a method for predictive modelling in machine learning, in which an algorithm is used to predict continuous outcomes

# Linear Regression

Linear Regression is **a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning**. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting

# Multi-Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression is **a statistical technique that uses multiple linear regression to model more complex relationships between two or more independent variables and one dependent variable**
